   * Property has been converted to a GADT, and will be Property NoInfo
     or Property HasInfo.
     This was done to make sure that ensureProperty is only used on
     properties that do not have Info.
     Transition guide:
     - Change all "Property" to "Property NoInfo" or "Property WithInfo"
       (The compiler can tell you if you got it wrong!)
     - To construct a RevertableProperty, it is useful to use the new
       (&lt;!&gt;) operator
     - Constructing a list of properties can be problimatic, since
       Property NoInto and Property WithInfo are different types and cannot
       appear in the same list. To deal with this, "props" has been added,
       and can built up a list of properties of different types,
       using the same (&amp;) and (!) operators that are used to build
       up a host's properties.
   * Add descriptions of how to set missing fields to --list-fields output.
   * Properties now form a tree, instead of the flat list used before.
     This includes the properties used inside a container.
   * Fix info propagation from fallback combinator's second Property.
   * Added systemd configuration properties.
   * Added journald configuration properties.
   * Added more network interface configuration properties.
   * Implemented OS.preserveNetwork."""]]
