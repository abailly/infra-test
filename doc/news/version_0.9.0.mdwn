propellor 0.9.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * Avoid encoding the current stable suite in propellor's code,
     since that poses a difficult transition around the release,
     and can easily be wrong if an older version of propellor is used.
     Instead, the os property for a stable system includes the suite name
     to use, eg Stable "wheezy".
   * stdSourcesList uses the stable suite name, to avoid unwanted
     immediate upgrades to the next stable release.
   * debCdn switched from cdn.debian.net to http.debian.net, which seems to be
     better managed now.
   * Docker: Avoid committing container every time it's started up."""]]
