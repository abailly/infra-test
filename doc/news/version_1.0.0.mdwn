propellor 1.0.0 released with [[!toggle text="these changes"]]
[[!toggleable text="""
   * propellor --spin can now be used to update remote hosts, without
     any central git repository needed. The central git repository is
     still useful for running propellor from cron, but this simplifies
     getting started with propellor, and allows for more ad-hoc usage.
   * The git repo url, if any, is updated whenever propellor --spin is used.
   * Added prosody module, contributed by Félix Sipma.
   * Can be used to configure tor hidden services. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
   * When multiple gpg keys are added, ensure that the privdata file
     can be decrypted by all of them.
   * Convert GpgKeyId to newtype. (API change)
   * DigitalOcean.distroKernel property now reboots into the distribution
     kernel when necessary.
   * Avoid outputting color setting sequences when not run on a terminal.
   * Docker code simplified by using `docker exec`; needs docker 1.3.1.
   * Docker containers are now a separate data type, cannot be included
     in the main host list, and are instead passed to
     Docker.docked. (API change)
   * Added support for using debootstrap from propellor.
   * Propellor can now be used to provision chroots.
   * systemd-nspawn containers can now be managed by propellor, very similar
     to its handling of docker containers.
   * Debian package will be maintained by Gergely Nagy."""]]
