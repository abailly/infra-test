Currently, a RevertableProperty's Properties always both HasInfo. This
means that if a Property NoInfo is updated to be a RevertableProperty, and
someplace called ensureProperty on it, that will refuse to compile.

The workaround is generally to export the original NoInfo property under
a different name, so it can still be used with ensureProperty.

This could be fixed:

	data RevertableProperty i1 i2 where
		RProp :: Property i1 -> Property i2 -> RevertableProperty i1 i2

However, needing to write "RevertableProperty HasInfo NoInfo" is quite
a mouthful!

Since only 2 places in the propellor source code currently need to deal
with this, it doesn't currently seem worth making the change, unless a less
intrusive way can be found.
