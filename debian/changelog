propellor (2.2.0) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * When running shimmed (eg in a docker container),
    improve process name visible in ps.
  * Add shebang to cron.daily etc files. 
  * Some changes to tor configuration, minor API change.
  * Propellor now builds itself, and gets its build dependencies installed
    when deploying to a new host, without needing the Makefile.

propellor (2.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Additional tor properties, including support for making relays, 
    and naming bridges, relays, etc.
  * New Cron.Times data type, which allows Cron.job to install
    daily/monthly/weekly jobs that anacron can run. (API change)
  * Fix Git.daemonRunning to restart inetd after enabling the git server.
  * Ssh.authorizedKey: Make the authorized_keys file and .ssh directory
    be owned by the user, not root.
  * Ssh.knownHost: Make the .ssh directory be owned by the user, not root.

propellor (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Property has been converted to a GADT, and will be Property NoInfo
    or Property HasInfo.
    This was done to make sure that ensureProperty is only used on
    properties that do not have Info.
    Transition guide:
    - Change all "Property" to "Property NoInfo" or "Property WithInfo"
      (The compiler can tell you if you got it wrong!)
    - To construct a RevertableProperty, it is useful to use the new
      (<!>) operator
    - Constructing a list of properties can be problimatic, since
      Property NoInto and Property WithInfo are different types and cannot
      appear in the same list. To deal with this, "props" has been added,
      and can built up a list of properties of different types,
      using the same (&) and (!) operators that are used to build
      up a host's properties.
  * Add descriptions of how to set missing fields to --list-fields output.
  * Properties now form a tree, instead of the flat list used before.
    This includes the properties used inside a container.
  * Fix info propagation from fallback combinator's second Property.
  * Added systemd configuration properties.
  * Added journald configuration properties.
  * Added more network interface configuration properties.
  * Implemented OS.preserveNetwork.

propellor (1.3.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * SSHFP records are also generated for CNAMES of hosts.
  * Merge Utiity modules from git-annex.
  * Ignore bogus DNS when spinning the local host.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Thu, 15 Jan 2015 14:02:07 -0400

propellor (1.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug that prevented deploying ssh host keys when the file for the
    key didn't already exist.
  * DNS records for hosts with known ssh public keys now automatically
    include SSHFP records.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 04 Jan 2015 19:51:34 -0400

propellor (1.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * --spin checks if the DNS matches any configured IP address property
    of the host, and if not, sshes to the host by IP address.
  * Detect #774376 and refuse to use docker if the system is so broken
    that docker exec doesn't enter a chroot.
  * Update intermediary propellor in --spin --via
  * Added support for DNSSEC.
  * Ssh.hostKey and Ssh.hostKeys no longer install public keys from
    the privdata. Instead, the public keys are included in the
    configuration. (API change)
  * Ssh.hostKeys now removes any host keys of types that the host is not
    configured to have.
  * sshPubKey is renamed to Ssh.pubKey, and has an added SshKeyType
    parameter. (API change)
  * CloudAtCost.deCruft no longer forces randomHostKeys.
  * Fix build with process 1.2.1.0.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 04 Jan 2015 17:17:44 -0400

propellor (1.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Revert ensureProperty warning message, too many false positives in places
    where Info is correctly propigated. Better approach needed.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 21 Dec 2014 21:41:11 -0400

propellor (1.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added CryptPassword to PrivDataField, for password hashes as produced 
    by crypt(3).
  * User.hasPassword and User.hasSomePassword will now use either
    a CryptPassword or a Password from privdata, depending on which is set.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Wed, 17 Dec 2014 16:30:44 -0400

propellor (1.2.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Display a warning when ensureProperty is used on a property which has
    Info and is so prevented from propigating it.
  * Removed boolProperty; instead the new toResult can be used. (API change)
  * Include Propellor.Property.OS, which was accidentially left out of the
    cabal file in the last release.
  * Fix Apache.siteEnabled to update the config file and reload apache when
    configuration has changed.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Tue, 09 Dec 2014 00:05:09 -0400

propellor (1.1.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * --spin target --via relay causes propellor to bounce through an
    intermediate relay host, which handles any necessary uploads
    when provisioning the target host.
  * --spin can be passed multiple hosts, and it will provision each host
    in turn.
  * Add --merge, to combine multiple --spin commits into a single, more useful
    commit.
  * Hostname parameters not containing dots are looked up in the DNS to
    find the full hostname.
  * propellor --spin can now deploy propellor to hosts that do not have 
    git, ghc, or apt-get. This is accomplished by uploading a fairly
    portable precompiled tarball of propellor.
  * Propellor.Property.OS contains properties that can be used to do a clean
    reinstall of the OS of an existing host. This can be used, for example,
    to do an in-place conversion from Fedora to Debian.
    This is experimental; use with caution!
  * Added group-related properties. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Added Git.barerepo. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * Added Grub.installed and Grub.boots properties.
  * New HostContext can be specified when a PrivData value varies per host.
  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword now default to using HostContext.
    To specify a different context, use hasSomePassword' and
    hasPassword' (API change)
  * hasSomePassword and hasPassword now make sure shadow passwords are enabled.
  * cron.runPropellor now runs propellor, rather than using its Makefile.
    This is more robust.
  * propellor.debug can be set in the git config to enable more persistent
    debugging output.
  * Run apt-cache policy with LANG=C so it works on other locales.
  * endAction can be used to register an action to run once propellor
    has successfully run on a host.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Sun, 07 Dec 2014 15:23:59 -0400

propellor (1.0.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * propellor --spin can now be used to update remote hosts, without
    any central git repository needed. The central git repository is
    still useful for running propellor from cron, but this simplifies
    getting started with propellor, and allows for more ad-hoc usage.
  * The git repo url, if any, is updated whenever propellor --spin is used.
  * Added prosody module, contributed by Félix Sipma.
  * Can be used to configure tor hidden services. Thanks, Félix Sipma.
  * When multiple gpg keys are added, ensure that the privdata file
    can be decrypted by all of them.
  * Convert GpgKeyId to newtype. (API change)
  * DigitalOcean.distroKernel property now reboots into the distribution
    kernel when necessary.
  * Avoid outputting color setting sequences when not run on a terminal.
  * Docker code simplified by using `docker exec`; needs docker 1.3.1.
  * Docker containers are now a separate data type, cannot be included
    in the main host list, and are instead passed to
    Docker.docked. (API change)
  * Added support for using debootstrap from propellor.
  * Propellor can now be used to provision chroots.
  * systemd-nspawn containers can now be managed by propellor, very similar
    to its handling of docker containers.
  * Debian package will be maintained by Gergely Nagy.

 -- Joey Hess <id@joeyh.name>  Fri, 21 Nov 2014 20:58:02 -0400

propellor (0.9.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Added nginx module, contributed by Félix Sipma.
  * Added firewall module, contributed by Arnaud Bailly.
  * Apache: Fix daemon reload when enabling a new module or site.
  * Docker: Stop using docker.io; that was a compat symlink in
    the Debian package which has been removed in docker.io 1.3.1~dfsg1-2.
  * Orphaned the Debian package, as I am retiring from Debian.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 08 Nov 2014 15:57:36 -0400

propellor (0.9.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Docker: Add ability to control when containers restart.
  * Docker: Default to always restarting containers, so they come back 
    up after reboots and docker daemon upgrades. (API change)
  * Fix loop when a docker host that does not exist was docked.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 24 Oct 2014 09:57:31 -0400

propellor (0.9.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Avoid encoding the current stable suite in propellor's code,
    since that poses a difficult transition around the release,
    and can easily be wrong if an older version of propellor is used.
    Instead, the os property for a stable system includes the suite name
    to use, eg Stable "wheezy".
  * stdSourcesList uses the stable suite name, to avoid unwanted
    immediate upgrades to the next stable release. (API change)
  * debCdn switched from cdn.debian.net to http.debian.net, which seems to be
    better managed now.
  * Docker: Avoid committing container every time it's started up.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 10 Oct 2014 11:37:45 -0400

propellor (0.8.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * The Debian package now includes a single-revision git repository in
    /usr/src/propellor/, and ~/.propellor/ is set up to use this repository as
    its origin remote. This avoids relying on the security of the github
    repository when using the Debian package.
  * The /usr/bin/propellor wrapper will warn when ~/.propellor/ is out of date
    and a newer version is available, after which git merge upstream/master
    can be run to merge it.
  * Included the config.hs symlink to config-simple.hs in the cabal and Debian
    packages.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 22 Aug 2014 13:02:01 -0400

propellor (0.8.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix bug in File.containsLines that caused lines that were already in the
    file to sometimes be appended to the end.
  * Hostname.sane also configures /etc/mailname.
  * Fixed Postfix.satellite to really configure relayhost = smtp.domain.
  * Avoid reconfiguring postfix unncessarily when it already has a relayhost.
  * Deal with apache 2.4's change in the name of site-available config files.
  * Hostname aliases can now be used in several places, including --spin
    and Ssh.knownHost.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Mon, 04 Aug 2014 01:12:19 -0400

propellor (0.8.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Run apt-get update in initial bootstrap.
  * --list-fields now includes a table of fields that are not currently set,
    but would be used if they got set.
  * Remove .gitignore from cabal file list, to avoid build failure on Debian.
    Closes: #754334

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 09 Jul 2014 22:11:31 -0400

propellor (0.8.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Completely reworked privdata storage. There is now a single file,
    and each host is sent only the privdata that its Properties actually use.

    To transition existing privdata, run propellor against a host and
    watch out for the red failure messages, and run the suggested commands
    to store the privdata using the new storage scheme. You may find
    it useful to run the old version of propellor to extract data from the old
    privdata files during this migration.

    Several properties that use privdata now require a context to be
    specified. If in doubt, you can use anyContext, or
    Context "hostname.example.com"

  * Add --edit to edit a privdata value in $EDITOR.
  * Add --list-fields to list all currently set privdata fields, along with
    the hosts that use them.
  * Fix randomHostKeys property to run openssh-server's postinst in a
    non-failing way.
  * Hostname.sane now cleans up the 127.0.0.1 localhost line in /etc/hosts,
    to avoid eg, apache complaining "Could not reliably determine the
    server's fully qualified domain name".

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sun, 06 Jul 2014 18:28:08 -0400

propellor (0.7.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * combineProperties no longer stops when a property fails; now it continues
    trying to satisfy all properties on the list before propigating the
    failure.
  * Attr is renamed to Info. (API change)
  * Renamed wrapper to propellor to make cabal installation of propellor work.
  * When git gpg signature of a fetched git branch cannot be verified,
    propellor will now continue running, but without merging in that branch.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 13 Jun 2014 10:06:40 -0400

propellor (0.6.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Docker containers now propagate DNS attributes out to the host they're
    docked in. So if a docker container sets a DNS alias, every container
    it's docked in will automatically be added to a DNS round-robin,
    when propellor is used to manage DNS for the domain.
  * Apt.stdSourcesList no longer needs a suite to be specified. (API change)
  * Added --dump to dump out a field of a host's privdata. Useful for editing
    it.
  * Propellor's output now includes the hostname being provisioned, or
    when provisioning a docker container, the container name.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 05 Jun 2014 17:32:14 -0400

propellor (0.5.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix unattended-upgrades config for !stable.
  * Ensure that kernel hostname is same as /etc/hostname when configuring
    hostname.
  * Added modules for some hosting providers (DigitalOcean, CloudAtCost).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 29 May 2014 14:29:53 -0400

propellor (0.5.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * A bug that caused propellor to hang when updating a running docker
    container appears to have been fixed. Note that since it affects
    the propellor process that serves as "init" of docker containers,
    they have to be restarted for the fix to take effect.
  * Licence changed from GPL to BSD.
  * A few changes to allow building Propellor on OSX. One user reports
    successfully using it there.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 17 May 2014 16:42:55 -0400

propellor (0.5.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Primary DNS servers now have allow-transfer automatically populated
    with the IP addresses of secondary dns servers. So, it's important
    that all secondary DNS servers have an ipv4 (and/or ipv6) property
    configured.
  * Deal with old ssh connection caching sockets.
  * Add missing build deps and deps. Closes: #745459

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 24 Apr 2014 18:09:58 -0400

propellor (0.5.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Removed root domain records from SOA. Instead, use RootDomain
    when calling Dns.primary. (API change)
  * Dns primary and secondary properties are now revertable.
  * When unattendedUpgrades is enabled on an Unstable or Testing system,
    configure it to allow the upgrades.
  * New website, https://propellor.branchable.com/

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2014 17:38:02 -0400

propellor (0.4.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Propellor can configure primary DNS servers, including generating
    zone files, which is done by looking at the properties of hosts
    in a domain.
  * The `cname` property was renamed to `alias` as it does not always
    generate CNAME in the DNS. (API change)
  * Constructor of Property has changed (use `property` function instead).
    (API change)
  * All Property combinators now combine together their Attr settings.
    So Attr settings can be made inside a propertyList, for example.
  * Run all cron jobs under chronic from moreutils to avoid unnecessary
    mails.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2014 02:09:56 -0400

propellor (0.3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Merge scheduler bug fix from git-annex.
  * Support for provisioning hosts with ssh and gpg keys.
  * Obnam support.
  * Apache support.
  * Postfix satellite system support.
  * Properties can now be satisfied differently on different operating
    systems.
  * Standard apt configuration for stable now includes backports.
  * Cron jobs generated by propellor use flock(1) to avoid multiple
    instances running at a time.
  * Add support for SSH ed25519 keys.
    (Thanks, Franz Pletz.)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 17 Apr 2014 20:07:33 -0400

propellor (0.3.0) unstable; urgency=medium

  * ipv6to4: Ensure interface is brought up automatically on boot.
  * Enabling unattended upgrades now ensures that cron is installed and
    running to perform them.
  * Properties can be scheduled to only be checked after a given time period.
  * Fix bootstrapping of dependencies.
  * Fix compilation on Debian stable.
  * Include security updates in sources.list for stable and testing.
  * Use ssh connection caching, especially when bootstrapping.
  * Properties now run in a Propellor monad, which provides access to
    attributes of the host. (API change)

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Apr 2014 01:19:05 -0400

propellor (0.2.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * docker: Fix laziness bug that caused running containers to be
    unnecessarily stopped and committed.
  * Add locking so only one propellor can run at a time on a host.
  * docker: When running as effective init inside container, wait on zombies.
  * docker: Added support for configuring shared volumes and linked
    containers.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Tue, 08 Apr 2014 02:07:37 -0400

propellor (0.2.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Now supports provisioning docker containers with architecture/libraries
    that do not match the host.
  * Fixed a bug that caused file modes to be set to 600 when propellor
    modified the file (did not affect newly created files).

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Fri, 04 Apr 2014 01:07:32 -0400

propellor (0.2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * First release with Debian package.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Thu, 03 Apr 2014 01:43:14 -0400

propellor (0.2.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added support for provisioning Docker containers.
  * Bootstrap deployment now pushes the git repo to the remote host
    over ssh, securely.
  * propellor --add-key configures a gpg key, and makes propellor refuse
    to pull commits from git repositories not signed with that key.
    This allows propellor to be securely used with public, non-encrypted
    git repositories without the possibility of MITM.
  * Added support for type-safe reversions. Only some properties can be
    reverted; the type checker will tell you if you try something that won't
    work.
  * New syntactic sugar for building a list of properties, including
    revertable properties.

 -- Joey Hess <joeyh@debian.org>  Wed, 02 Apr 2014 13:57:42 -0400
