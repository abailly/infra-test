-- | Primary dns server for a domain.
--
-- Most of the content of the zone file is configured by setting properties
-- of hosts. For example,
--
-- > host "foo.example.com"
-- >   & ipv4 "192.168.1.1"
-- >   & alias "mail.exmaple.com"
--
-- Will cause that hostmame and its alias to appear in the zone file,
-- with the configured IP address.
--
-- The [(BindDomain, Record)] list can be used for additional records
-- that cannot be configured elsewhere. This often includes NS records,
-- TXT records and perhaps CNAMEs pointing at hosts that propellor does
-- not control.
--
-- The primary server is configured to only allow zone transfers to
-- secondary dns servers. These are determined in two ways:
--
-- 1. By looking at the properties of other hosts, to find hosts that
-- are configured as the secondary dns server.
--
-- 2. By looking for NS Records in the passed list of records.
--
-- In either case, the secondary dns server Host should have an ipv4 and/or
-- ipv6 property defined.
